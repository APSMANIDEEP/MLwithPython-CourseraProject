# MLwithPython-CourseraProject
This is a project that I did as a final project for the course Machine Learning with Python which is a part of IBM Data Science Professional Certificate in Coursera


The following the final report that I got for various Classification algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression

| Algorithm          | Jaccard | F1-score | LogLoss |
|--------------------|---------|----------|---------|
| KNN                | 0.72    | 0.70     | NA      |
| Decision Tree      | 0.74    | 0.70     | NA      |
| SVM                | 0.72    | 0.62     | NA      |
| LogisticRegression | 0.74    | 0.63     | 0.56    |
